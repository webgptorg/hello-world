# âœ¨ Hello World!

In this repository, you will find a simple example of how to write your first [Book](https://github.com/webgptorg/book) and run it using the [Promptbook Engine](https://github.com/webgptorg/promptbook) via CLI.

1) First, you need to install the Promptbook Ecosystem. Currently, you can install it using NPM and run it via NPX. We are also working on an option to install it globally on your system:

```bash
npm i ptbk
```

2) Then you can run the example from this repository:

```bash
npx ptbk run ./promptbook-collection/hello.ptbk.md
```
