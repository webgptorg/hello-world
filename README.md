# âœ¨ Hello world!

In this repository, you can find a simple example of how to write your first [Book](https://github.com/webgptorg/book) and run it using the [Promptbook Engine](https://github.com/webgptorg/promptbook) via cli.


1) First, you need to install the Promptbook Ecosystem. For now, you can install it using NPM and run via NPX BUT we are working on an option to install it to your system globally:

```bash
npm i ptbk
```

2) Then you can run the example from this repository:

```bash
npx ptbk run ./promptbook-collection/hello.ptbk.md
```
